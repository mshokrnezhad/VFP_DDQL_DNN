# VFP_DDQL_DNN
A Virtual Function Placement (VFP) method using Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL) powered by linear Deep Neural Network (DNN) layers. 

This repository implements the VNF placement agent described in this paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10207694/

This method employs ReNet as its learning environment. For more details, check here: https://github.com/mshokrnezhad/ReNet
